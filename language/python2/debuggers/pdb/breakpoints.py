'''
Set a breakpoint
- $ b(reak) ([file:]lineno | function) [, condition]
    - It appears that a filename and function name can't be used together. Only a filename and lineno may be used together

Delete a breakpoint
- cl <breakpoint number>: remove the specified breakpoint
    - Without space-separated number arguments, 'cl' will clear all breakpoints
